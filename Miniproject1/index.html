        <h2>Customer Review</h2>
        <p><b>&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;P.Akash:</b><br>I had a very good experience with flight booking website. The customer service is really good. The customer 
            service representative Herman really did a great job by explaining everything and helped me a lot in chosing the best deal. They really care about their customers</p>

        <p><b>&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;&starf;Mohd Mustafa:</b><br>We booked a trip to Australia through these guys and saved several thousand dollars. We read the reviews
             and knew going into it that if we needed to change our flight schedule it could be difficult. Thankfully we didn't have to do it and all of our flights came 
             through just fine. Thanks
