                    <p>Biryani is one of the most amazing royal delicacies introduced to Indians by the Persians. Since
                        then it has been much popular and is considered to be a luxurious treat to enjoy on special
                        occasions. Making a chicken biryani in authentic dum style does take some time and needs little
                        expertise. </p> <!-- discription of biryani-->

                            <b>Marinating the Chicken:</b><br>
                            In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, turmeric powder, red chili powder,
                            garam masala, salt, and vegetable oil.<br>
                            Add the chicken pieces to the marinade, ensuring they are well-coated.<br>
                            Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or overnight for best results.<br><br>
                            <b>Cooking the Rice:</b><br>
                            Wash the basmati rice thoroughly and soak it in water for 30 minutes.<br>
                            In a large pot, bring 4-5 cups of water to a boil.<br>
                            Add the soaked rice, green cardamom pods, cloves, cinnamon stick, bay leaf, and salt to the
                            boiling water.<br>
                            Cook the rice until it is about 70-80% cooked (it should still have a bite to it). Drain the
                            rice and set it aside.<br><br>
                            <b>Frying the Onions:</b><br>
                            Heat some oil in a pan and add the thinly sliced onions.<br>
                            Fry the onions until they are brown and crispy. Remove half of the fried onions and set them
                            aside for garnishing.<br><br>
                            <b>Assembling the Biryani:</b><br>
                            In a large, heavy-bottomed pot or biryani pot, add a layer of marinated chicken at the
                            bottom.<br>
                            Top the chicken with a layer of cooked rice.<br>
                            Sprinkle some chopped mint leaves, chopped cilantro, chopped green chilies, and the fried
                            onions that you set aside earlier.<br>
                            Repeat the layers until all the chicken and rice are used up, with the final layer being
                            rice and garnishes.<br>
                            Drizzle ghee over the top layer.<br><br>
                            <b>Cooking the Biryani:</b><br>
                            Place the pot on low heat and cover it with a tight-fitting lid or seal it with dough to
                            trap the steam.<br>
                            Cook on low heat for about 20-25 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through and the
                            rice is fully cooked and aromatic.<br>
                            You can also place a tava (griddle) under the pot to ensure even cooking and to prevent the
                            bottom from burning.<br>
                            Once done, remove from heat and let it rest for a few minutes before opening the
                            lid.<br><br>
                            <b>Garnishing:</b><br>
                            Before serving, garnish the biryani with saffron-soaked milk and the remaining fried
                            onions.<br>
                            Serve your homemade chicken biryani with raita (yogurt sauce) or a side salad. Enjoy your
                            delicious homemade biryani!

                    <p>If you’re a fan of bread and potatoes, you’re going to love this Punjabi Aloo Paratha or Aloo ka
                        Paratha. Sometimes spelled Alu Paratha, this potato stuffed flatbread is a popular Indian
                        breakfast that combines two of my favorite starches in a single delectable package. Crisp on the
                        outside and tender on the inside, this humble meal is as comforting as a hug. What’s not to

                        <p>
                            1. <b>Prepare the Dough:</b></Prepare> <br>
                            a. In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour and a pinch of salt. <br>
                            b. Gradually add water and knead the dough until it's smooth and soft. <br>
                            c. Add a tablespoon of oil or ghee and knead the dough again until it's well incorporated.
                            <br>
                            d. Cover the dough with a damp cloth and let it rest for 20-30 minutes. <br>
                            <b>2. Prepare the Potato Filling:</b> <br>
                            a. In a mixing bowl, combine the mashed potatoes, finely chopped onion (if using), green
                            chilies, grated ginger, cumin seeds, garam masala, red chili powder, turmeric powder,
                            coriander powder, salt, and chopped coriander leaves (if using). <br>
                            b. Mix everything well to make a uniform filling. <br>
                            <b>3. Make Aloo Parathas: </b><br>
                            a. Divide the dough into equal-sized balls, slightly smaller than a golf ball. <br>
                            b. Take one dough ball, flatten it slightly, and dip it into dry wheat flour. <br>
                            c. Roll out the dough ball into a small circle, about 4-5 inches in diameter. <br>
                            d. Place a portion of the potato filling (about 2-3 tablespoons) in the center of the
                            rolled-out dough. <br>
                            e. Carefully fold the edges of the dough over the filling, sealing it completely to form a
                            stuffed ball. <br>
                            f. Gently flatten the stuffed ball with your hands. <br>
                            <b>4. Roll Out Aloo Parathas: </b><br>
                            a. Dip the stuffed ball into dry wheat flour again. <br>
                            b. Roll out the stuffed ball into a paratha, about 7-8 inches in diameter. Be gentle while
                            rolling to prevent the filling from coming out. <br>
                            c. You can make the paratha as thin or thick as you prefer. <br>
                            <b>5. Cook Aloo Parathas:</b> <br>
                            a. Heat a griddle or a flat pan over medium-high heat. <br>
                            b. Once the pan is hot, place the rolled-out paratha on it. <br>
                            c. Cook for a minute or two until you see bubbles forming on the surface. <br>
                            d. Flip the paratha and spread a little ghee or oil on the cooked side. <br>
                            e. Flip again and spread ghee or oil on the other side. Press gently with a spatula. <br>
                            f. Cook until both sides are golden brown and crispy. <br>
                            g. Repeat the process with the remaining dough and filling. <br>
                            <b>6. Serve: Serve hot Aloo Parathas with yogurt, pickles, or any chutney of your choice.
                            </b> <br>

                        <p>
                            1. In a mixing bowl, combine the milk powder, all-purpose flour, ghee, milk, and baking
                            soda. Knead the mixture into a smooth and soft dough. Add a little more milk if needed.<br>
                            2. Divide the dough into small, equal-sized portions and shape them into round balls,
                            ensuring there are no cracks.<br>
                            3. Heat oil or ghee in a deep frying pan over medium-low heat. Fry the dough balls in
                            batches until they turn golden brown, making sure to maintain a low heat to cook them evenly
                            without burning.<br>
                            4. Remove the fried Gulab Jamuns from the oil and place them on a paper towel to drain
                            excess oil.<br>
                            5. In a separate saucepan, prepare the sugar syrup by dissolving 2 cups of sugar in 1 cup of
                            water. Add a pinch of cardamom powder for flavor.<br>
                            6. Simmer the sugar syrup for about 5-7 minutes until it slightly thickens. It should have a
                            sticky consistency.<br>
                            7. Remove the sugar syrup from heat and let it cool for a few minutes.<br>
                            8. Carefully place the fried Gulab Jamuns into the warm sugar syrup. Let them soak for at
                            least 1-2 hours so they can absorb the syrup and become soft and sweet.<br>
                            9. Serve Gulab Jamun warm or at room temperature, garnished with chopped nuts if desired.
                            Enjoy this delectable Indian dessert!

                            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking soda</li>
                            <li>1 teaspoon ghee (clarified butter)</li>
                            <li>A pinch of saffron strands (optional)</li>
                            <li>1 cup sugar</li>
                            <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                            <li>1/2 teaspoon cardamom powder</li>
                            <li>Oil for deep frying</li>
                        </ul>
                    </details>

                    <details> <!-- detail section for instruction -->
                        <summary><b>Instructions:</b></summary>
                        <p>
                            1. In a mixing bowl, combine the all-purpose flour, gram flour, yogurt, baking soda, and
                            ghee. Mix well to form a smooth batter. If desired, add saffron strands for color and
                            flavor.<br>
                            2. Cover the batter and let it ferment for about 6-8 hours or overnight. This will allow it
                            to develop a slightly tangy flavor.<br>
                            3. In a separate saucepan, prepare the sugar syrup by dissolving sugar in water. Add
                            cardamom powder and simmer the syrup until it reaches a one-string consistency. Keep it
                            warm.<br>
                            4. Heat oil in a deep frying pan over medium heat. You can test if the oil is ready by
                            dropping a small amount of batter into it; if it sizzles and rises to the surface, the oil
                            is hot enough.<br>
                            5. Pour the fermented batter into a squeeze bottle or a plastic bag with a small hole in one
                            corner to create a makeshift piping bag.<br>
                            6. Squeeze the batter into the hot oil in a spiral or pretzel shape, working from the center
                            outwards. Fry until the jalebis turn golden brown and crisp.<br>
                            7. Remove the fried jalebis from the oil and immediately dip them into the warm sugar syrup.
                            Ensure they are well-coated in the syrup.<br>
                            8. Allow the jalebis to soak in the syrup for a few seconds, then remove them and place them
                            on a serving plate. Repeat the process with the remaining batter.<br>
                            9. Serve Jalebi warm or at room temperature. They are best enjoyed fresh and can be
                            garnished with chopped nuts if desired. Enjoy this sweet, syrupy delight!

                        <p>
                            1. Preheat your grill to medium-high heat. Season the chicken breasts with olive oil, salt,
                            and pepper.<br>
                            2. Grill the chicken for about 6-7 minutes per side, or until the internal temperature
                            reaches 165°F (74°C) and the chicken is no longer pink in the center. Remove from the grill
                            and let it rest for a few minutes before slicing it into strips.<br>
                            3. In a large salad bowl, combine the mixed greens, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, red onion,
                            feta cheese, and black olives.<br>
                            4. Add the grilled chicken strips on top of the salad.<br>
                            5. In a small bowl, prepare your favorite salad dressing (such as balsamic vinaigrette,
                            ranch, or honey mustard).<br>
                            6. Drizzle the dressing over the salad or serve it on the side.<br>
                            7. Toss the salad gently to combine all the ingredients.<br>
                            8. Serve the Grilled Chicken Salad immediately, garnished with additional feta cheese and a
                            sprinkle of freshly ground black pepper, if desired.<br>

                            1. Peel and slice the ripe banana.<br>
                            2. In a blender, combine the mixed frozen berries, sliced banana, plain Greek yogurt, milk,

                            5. Once the smoothie is well-blended and reaches the desired consistency, pour it into a

                            7. Serve your Fruit and Yogurt Smoothie immediately, and enjoy this nutritious and delicious

            <h1>About US</h1>
            <p>Home cooks are our heroes—it's as simple as that. Allrecipes is a community built by and for kitchen experts: The cooks who will dedicate the weekend to a perfect beef bourguignon but love the simplicity of a slow-cooker rendition, too. The bakers who labor over a showstopping 9-layer cake but will just as happily doctor boxed brownies for a decadent weeknight dessert. The entertainers who just want a solid snack spread, without tons of dirty dishes at the end of the night.
                Most importantly, Allrecipes connects home cooks with their greatest sources of inspiration — other home cooks. We're the world's leading digital food brand, and that inspires us to do everything possible to keep our community connected. Sixty-million home cooks deserve no less.</p>
